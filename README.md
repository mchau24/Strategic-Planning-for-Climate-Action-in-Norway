# Strategic Planning for Climate Action in Norway

## Overview
This project was developed as part of the module Strategy Modelling and Management during my master’s course at the University of Strathclyde. The report was created collaboratively by a group of five to advise the Norwegian government on strategic planning to achieve Sustainable Development Goal (SDG) 13: Climate Action by 2040.

The analysis leverages strategic planning frameworks - SPECCTRE, SWOT, Scenario Planning, and Competence Mapping - to provide a holistic approach to Norway’s climate action strategy. Each section of the report is structured to allow readers to understand how each strategic tool (SPECCTRE, SWOT, Scenario Planning, and Competence Mapping) contributes to forming a strategy for climate action.
